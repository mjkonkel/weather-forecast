# 5-Day Weather Forecast
## Repo for Challenge #6 of the Bootcamp - Create a 5-Day Weather Forecast Application

### Decsription

For Challenge 6 of the bootcamp we were tasked with creating an application that shows the current weather and 5-day forecast for a given city. The user inputs a city name and the application searches for a city and displays weather data for temp, wind, and humidity from the OpenWeatherMap API on the page. This application uses APIs from OpenWeatherMap (geo, current weather, and 5-day forecast). The application also uses local storage to save user input and creates buttons in a list of previous searches. Users can click on these buttons to display the weather data for that city again.

### Installation
