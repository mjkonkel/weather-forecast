# 5-Day Weather Forecast
## Repo for Challenge #6 of the Bootcamp - Create a 5-Day Weather Forecast Application

### Decsription

For Challenge 6 of the bootcamp we were tasked with creating an application that shows the 5-day forecast for a given city. The user inputs a city name and the application searches for a city and displays weather data for temp, wind, and humidity from the OpenWeatherMap API on the page. This application uses APIs from OpenWeatherMap (geo, current weather, and 5-day forecast).
